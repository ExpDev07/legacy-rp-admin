                    <center>Legacy Roleplay – Official Rules</center>
                </h1>
                <center><h4>(Last Updated: 03/05/2019)</h4></center>
                <p class="lead">Legacy Roleplay, unlike many other servers out there, mainly focuses on roleplay rather
                    than combat.
                    We strive to achieve high-quality roleplay through a wide variety of set rules and a strict
                    administration.</p>
                <p>There is a very long list of rules ahead of you, so we advise you to make yourself comfortable. It is
                    extremely important that you understand and follow all of them. Rule violations will be taken very
                    seriously.</p>
                <p>We have implemented a warning system. Usually, this means that you get three warnings before you get
                    banned from the server. However, depending on the context of previous warnings and current
                    situation, staff may decide to give more or none at all. It really boils down to the staff’s
                    decision.</p>
                <p><em><span class="lead">Note:</span> That if there is no punishment explicitly written for a specific
                        rule, the
                        staff reserves the
                        right to give any punishment they feel is necessary. If you feel like you were wrongly banned,
                        then
                        feel free to submit a ban appeal.</em></p>

            <h1 class="display-4">Adult Community Rules</h1>
            <p>Legacy Roleplay’s community generally consists of adults or people above the age of 18, however, this
                does not mean that you have to be said age to play. We respect and recognize the younger people that
                play on this server and will not tolerate any discrimination or bullying of any kind.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">People are very rarely unbanned for the offenses mention
                below.
            </div>
            <p><strong>(1.1)</strong> Bullying is punished with a permanent ban without appeal.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.2)</strong> Discrimination or sexism of any kind is punished with a permanent ban without
                appeal. Racist words are not welcomed regardless of what context you say them in.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.3)</strong> Swearing is generally allowed, however, we do not want personal slurs and
                swearing directed towards people outside of roleplay.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.4)</strong> Any threats made to the community or a person will be taken very seriously. A
                permanent ban will be issued without the chance to appeal. Depending on the context of the threat, we’ll
                happily assist the police with any inquiries.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.5)</strong> Any attempts made to damage or harm our infrastructure (see DDoS attack) is not
                tolerated. We will take threats to attack and attacks seriously and if deemed necessary, any evidence
                will be provided to the police to help lead to a conviction.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.6)</strong> The Staff Team reserves the right to ban any person from our servers at any time
                if they are found to be disruptive or if we have a valid reason to think that they are here to be
                disruptive.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.7)</strong> In roleplay, every situation is different, and it is difficult to detail
                everything here. Just keep in mind that this is an adult community and some things come down to using
                common sense.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.8)</strong> Encouraging or forcing other members of the community to break rules is strictly
                prohibited and will be punished with a ban.</p>
            <p><strong>(1.9)</strong> Providing false information such as your age when applying for a position/job at
                our servers or when asked by a staff member is not allowed. Keep in mind that you should never be asked
                to provide your full name, address, or any information that is personal.</p>

        <div class="content-box collapse multi-collapse" id="general_rules">
            <h1 class="display-4">General Rules</h1>
            <p><strong>(2.1.1)</strong> VDM (Vehicle Deathmatch) is strictly prohibited. At Legacy Roleplay, we define
                VDM as the act or effort of intentionally using a vehicle to kill or injure other persons, or, where a
                player kills another person, without intent, by reckless performance under circumstances where any sane
                individual would understand that such performance could beyond reasonable doubt result in the death of
                another person. Examples of VDM include, but are not limited to: intentionally running people over or
                causing explosions to vehicles in order to kill or injure any person(s), speeding excessively with a car
                hitting a motorcycle where the rider/passenger dies or causing an explosion to a vehicle in a high
                traffic area like Legion Square which results in the death of any person(s).</p>
            <p><strong>(2.1.2)</strong> An act in which a person uses his vehicle as a weapon in order to protect his
                own life from any direct or immediate threat, will not be considered VDM. A direct or immediate threat
                in this section is defined as any individual who actively attempts to take your life in the moment. If a
                person who attempts to kill you, but falls short of completing the act, tries to flee the scene, he is
                no longer considered a direct threat to your life.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.2</strong>) Random Deathmatch (also known as RDM) is the act of killing/downing somebody
                without first engaging in quality roleplay. The mentioned roleplay should always include directly
                initiating on somebody’s life or having your own life initiated on. You are also to give people an
                incentive and enough time to comply with your orders (e.g during a robbery, do not shoot after 3 seconds
                if they don’t listen). Note that we do not consider quick countdowns quality roleplay.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.3)</strong> Fear RP is not allowed. This means that you are to value your life at all times
                and act accordingly in situations. For example, if you have a gun pointed at you, then you are to listen
                to commands given by the person holding the gun or anyone affiliated with that person to ensure your own
                survival.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.4)</strong> Any modifications that change the functionality of the game or changes how our
                systems/scripts work (also known as modding and scripting) is strictly prohibited on our servers and
                will result in a permanent ban being issued. An example of a modification would be a crosshair or one
                that gives you free money.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.5)</strong> Bugs are inevitable as the server is in constant development. Exploiting any of
                these in-game bugs and using them to your advantage is not allowed. If you discover a bug that can be
                exploited, you are to immediately report it to any staff member available and they will make sure it’s
                taken care of. You are also not to exploit certain game mechanics such as using the deposit/withdraw for
                your car to repair it.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.6)</strong> Combat logging during any roleplay situation is considered exploitation. Some
                examples of this would be: logging out during a firefight, being chased by the police, arrested by the
                police, while dead awaiting a medic, logging out to save gear, rage-quitting, logging out whilst
                restrained/detained, etc. We are aware of common crashes, connection issues, etc, however, this is often
                reflected in the logs and staff will make an informed decision on whether you’ve tried to resolve the
                issue by, for example, logging back on.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.7)</strong> Trolling is the deliberate act of performing certain actions to provoke a
                reaction. We have a very clear list of what we consider trolling, but we advise using common sense as
                trolling is a very broad subject, and it is impossible to list everything. We consider the following
                trolling: running around while people are trying to roleplay, throwing yourself in front of vehicles,
                blocking people with your car without RP, jumping off buildings, bombarding people with messages, and
                playing soundboards/voice changers in-game without RP and in our discord channels. Depending on the
                severity, a violation of this rule could lead to a permanent ban without appeal.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.8</strong>) Breaking roleplay in-voice (also known as going Out of Character) is never
                allowed unless a staff member arrives and clearly announces that there now is an on-going staff
                situation. We have seen so many cases of people having personal arguments and threating to file reports,
                and we want to make clear that this is not allowed.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.9)</strong> Trading real-life items for any in-game luxury is not allowed. This is because we
                do not want to be seen as a commercial entity as we feel it is unethical and FiveM strictly prohibits
                it. Donations made to cover server costs is an exemption.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.10</strong>) We have long queues (full slots) at times due to a very active and engaging
                community. Therefore, we ask for you to kindly disconnect from the server to let other people in if you
                have other important business to attend for a few minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.11)</strong> Playing on the side-server is a bannable offense. When you log in, it can happen
                that you are sent to the “side-server”. This is a place where you are unable to see or render anyone.
                You are to leave immediately and reconnect.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.12)</strong> You are not to steal any helicopters if you find one. They are exclusive for
                some whitelisted jobs.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.13)</strong> Driving at the airstrip inside the international airport is considered Fail RP.
                You are also not to steal any vehicles that can found at the airport. Note that “airport” only refers to
                the area behind the gates leading to the airstrip.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.14)</strong> To ensure that the server’s performance keeps steady, we ask of you to wait for
                the vehicle to load at the car dealership before you proceed to look at the next one.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.15)</strong> When doing upgrades on your vehicle, make sure to deposit it to the garage and
                then withdraw it again to make the customizations persist over server restarts. There will be no refunds
                given for this.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.16)</strong> Presenting yourself as a person with the ability to clean money, and then
                scamming people for their dirty cash is not allowed.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.17)</strong> Stealing emergency vehicles is strictly prohibited unless you have a valid
                roleplay reason for it.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.18)</strong> Using your phone to call jobs in order for them to arrive only so you can rob,
                take them as a hostage, or perform any other illegal activities will be punished accordingly.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.19)</strong> When playing, it is important to keep to realistic capabilities. This includes
                not using GTA’s physics to perform actions that would not be possible in real life. Example: jumping off
                a bridge with a car, only to then fall 20 meters and survive.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.20)</strong> Ban evasion is not allowed. This means that, after banned, you may not play on
                other accounts to get around the ban or attempt anything that might trick staff into thinking you’re a
                different person.</p>
            <p><strong>(2.21)</strong> You are not allowed to play on alternate accounts. This is to combat ban evasion
                (which is also against the rules) as well as not to cause confusion regarding warnings and other things.
                Only play on one account!</p>
            <p><strong>(2.22)</strong> You may not advertise other communities through Legacy Roleplay, nor should you
                for any products/services/accounts for personal gain unless relevant to the server itself. A ban would
                be issued through the respective channel (e.g our Discord server) that you were using to
                advertise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-box collapse multi-collapse" id="roleplay_rules">
            <h1 class="display-4">Roleplay Rules</h1>
            <p><strong>(3.1)</strong> Powergaming is strictly prohibited. This is when you aim to maximize progress
                towards a specific goal, to the exclusion of other considerations such as storytelling (roleplay) and
                atmosphere.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.2)</strong> FailRP - is the act of failing to engage in roleplay. When playing, you must
                always be engaging in roleplay.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.3)</strong> You must remain in-character always unless a staff member authorizes you to speak
                out of character by declaring a staff situation. We value roleplay over everything.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.4)</strong> All OOC (Out of Character) interactions must be made through the “OOC Proximity”
                chat channel. You can use this by typing the command: "/oocp ".</p>
            <p><strong>(3.5)</strong> You are to always have and be able to use a microphone while playing on our
                servers.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.6)</strong> You must hot-mic all communication that is made outside of the server’s voice
                channel if the it is relevant to the roleplay. This means, for example, that if you are communicating
                with a fellow team member on Discord or Teamspeak and you are within the audio proximity of another
                player (they can hear you), then you must ensure that player can overhear everything that you are
                saying. Note that this rule does not apply if you are in a direct gunfight or if you are in no roleplay
                situation at all.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.6.1)</strong> When your communication devices have been stripped from you, then all
                communication is to be made through proximity/direct [voice] chat.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.7)</strong> Continuing to roleplay a character of a sensitive nature after being requested to
                stop is punishable by a ban. A sensitive character could, for example, be Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin.
            </p>
            <p><strong>(3.8)</strong> Baiting is not allowed. Baiting for the sake of a gunfight is not considered
                roleplay. A few examples of baiting are: doing donuts around the police to provoke a reaction, robbing a
                gas station only to start a gunfight, and standing on top of somebody’s car without any RP to get a
                reaction from the owner.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.9)</strong> After a server restart, all roleplay that happened within 15 minutes before
                should be forgotten.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.10)</strong> Roleplaying as a nude character is not allowed. An exception for this rule is if
                you are inside the strip club (Vanilla Unicorn).</p>
            <p><strong>(3.11)</strong> Playing as a sexist character is not tolerated at our servers regardless of how
                good your roleplay is. Punishment is a permanent ban.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.12)</strong> We recommend using "/me " when performing certain actions that greatly impacts
                the roleplay situation, as it greatly improves the quality and imersiveness of the roleplay.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.13)</strong> You are not allowed to “ass pull”. GTA’s inventory system allows you to pull out
                a big assault rifle from your pocket in half a second. This is unrealistic, so we have set a rule to
                prohibit this. Weapons not listed in 3.15 must be roleplayed by using “/me” to signalize the action of
                drawing the weapon. These weapons must be either drawn from a bag or a vehicle (police often do this).
            </p>
            <p><strong>(3.14)</strong> You may not use weapons not listed in 3.15 to blindfire when in cover.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.15)</strong> Pistols, mini/micro-SMG, one-handed melee weapons, and tec-9.</p>
            <p><strong>(3.16)</strong> OOC channels should not be used to resolve roleplay situations. This means that
                you should not use these channels to tell people that x and y are not allowed nor threaten to file
                reports. Of course, you may do this on before-hand, but not after actions have already been committed
                and/or roleplay is completed.</p>

            <p><strong>(4.2)</strong> You are not allowed to identify people by using their assigned IDs. This number
                is only to be used when you wish to report somebody or by staff when performing certain actions on
                players (such as kicking). Punishment is a kick or depending on the context, may lead to a more strict
                punishment.</p>
            <p><strong>(4.3)</strong> If you are restrained or if your communication devices have been removed then you
                must make yourself inactive on any other forms of communication besides proximity chat.</p>
            <p><strong>(4.4)</strong> Stream sniping is considered metagaming and is not allowed. If a player is

            <p>The rules listed below only applies in the Green Zone.</p>
            <p><strong>(6.1)</strong> The Green Zones are: Garages, Prison, and all Airports.</p>
            <p><strong>(6.2)</strong> The boundaries of the Green Zone are not to be abused in any way. Using the
                boundary to gain temporary protection from the police/robbers/hostile roleplay situations is not
                allowed. It is forbidden to retreat into the Green Zone.</p>

                phone such as: “we will shoot any cops within 10 kilometers” will not be accepted.</p>
            <p><strong>(7.4)</strong> When the police turn their sirens’ lights on to pull you over, roleplay is not
                initiated. This means that you cannot start shooting at police just for attempting to pull you over.
                Such actions will be classed as clear RDM.</p>
            <p><strong>(7.5)</strong> Any person wearing a mask is unidentifiable. This means that you should not
                remember who they are if they, for example, rob you. An exception to this is if they are wearing
                distinguishable gang clothing or have visible gang tattoos, in which case you can identify them by the

            <p><strong>(7.7)</strong> When robbing someone, all you can take is currently what’s in their inventory.

            <p><strong>(8.1.1)</strong> At least 5 police officers must be online for a bank heist to take place. We
                have a system in place which prohibits you from starting a robbery unless the required amount of cops
                are online.</p>
            <p><strong>(8.1.2)</strong> The police will always send a negotiator to talk to the robbers. You then have
                two options: start roleplaying with the negotiator or decline by asking him/her to leave. You may not
                shoot the negotiator. You may also not kidnap this person.</p>
            <p><strong>(8.1.3)</strong> Only 7 people, excluding any hostage(s), may actively participate in a bank

            <p><strong>(8.3)</strong> Negotiations are considered over if a shot is fired or if the police deem it
                necessary for immediate intervention. At this point, police are allowed to storm the building with armed

            <p><strong>(9.1)</strong> All police must have a working microphone and be available on discord.</p>
            <p><strong>(9.2)</strong> Police equipment (weapons, items, etc) are not to be exchanged with players
                outside of the force. This is only acceptable if there is solid roleplay behind it.</p>
            <p><strong>(9.3)</strong> Tasers (non-lethal force) should be used unless there is a direct danger to
                surrounding officers or civilians or otherwise instructed by a high-ranking officer. Otherwise, lethal
                force can be used to terminate the danger.</p>
            <p><strong>(9.4)</strong> The police role should not be abused to help friends.</p>
            <p><strong>(9.5)</strong> When going off-duty as an officer, you are to dispose of any equipment and
                vehicles that you got from the police department. You may also not get equipment from the PD while
                off-duty.</p>
            <p><strong>(9.6)</strong> Negotiators are not to be taken as a hostage. If you find yourself in such a

            <p><strong>(13.7)</strong> Staff will not discuss any internal information with anyone besides members of

            <p><strong>(13.8)</strong> All server rules apply to staff members. In certain situations, an override may
